# Predictive Analytics Course - Recovering economies during a pandemic

The purpose of this project was to make several predicitons on a dataset. Since this was peak pandemic, I chose to focus on the economic impact of COVID-19 policies. 

This analysis chose the following states/territories as a result of their disparate geographies and their relatively wide range of government intervention: California, New York, Florida, Washington D.C., Hawaii, and Nebraska. 

Using predictive analytic techniques and data from Google, Affinity, Womply, Paychex (for middle class - $27,000 - $60,000), and a government stringency index derived by Oxford university, this analysis found that the stringent government response to the pandemic and Google movement influenced the state’s economic outcomes.

Understanding that the government response often suppressed mobility, it makes intuitive sense that the stringency levels would correlate with the mobility data.

When combined, these data elements predicted the economic impacts with relatively high confidence. 

In addition, the economic data elements for the various states allowed this analysis to forecast 60 days into the future, to see how well a state’s economy will recover following the month of August 2020. 

The findings yielded: the less stringent the response, the better the economic performance. 

### Run Instructions
The Jupyter Notebook runs up to the K-Means section. From there, I pivoted to R (per instructor's requirements). Once the R codebook is run, the remaining Jupyter Notebook can commence.
