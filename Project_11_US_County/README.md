# US County Level Analysis (Multilinear regression, PCA, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification, Benford's Law)

### Concept 
The general concept was to do a complete EDA of county level data. However, I got carried away and went down a few rabbit holes since the data offered so many alternate avenues. 

### Methods
Regression, PCA, classification (Decision Tree and Random Forest), Benford's Law

### Parameters 
Sourced by FiveThirtyEight, DataWorld and extracted from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/etsc9287/2020-general-election-polls?select=county_statistics.csv

### Output
COVID case/death rates influencing the 2020 election
PCA to educe the number of features
Classifying counties by non-voting metrics
Benford's Law with increased orders of magnitude on the 2020 election
