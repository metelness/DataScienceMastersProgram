## Airline Safety Dashboard

This was a course-long project that had several tasks (milestones) surrounding airplane safety. The topic was provided by the instructor, but the data and the research were on the student's to research. The end goal wasn't so much to get the "right" data, but to effectively tell a story with the data we were able to gather. Within each task folder contains: the code provided on how the data were gathered, parsed, cleaned, the Tableau workbook that met the task requirements, and brief descriptions of the dashboard.  

### Task 1 
The first task was to create a dashboard for internal team members to study. The point was to show a technical audience that the hysteria over airplane safety was uncalled for.  

### Task 2
The second task was to convey the same message as task 1, but to the executive team.

No new code for this task, as the dashboards reworked the existing dataset. 

### Task 3
The 3rd task was to create a blog for the general public to see. 
- All items are related to the blog post about the safety of flying. 
- The Tableau dashboard contains some old and some new items from previous presentations.
- All data sources are cited at the bottom of the blog post.

### Task 4
The final task was to create an infographic that could be used in a major publication. It needed to be precise and convey that airplanes were safe.

Also included is the presentation that was provided to the instructor. The audio file is not included due to size limitations.
