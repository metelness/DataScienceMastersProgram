# Finding Statistical Relationships between NFL Team performance and the weather

### Senopsis:
Football is played all over the country, from Miami to Buffalo. We all know Miami and Buffalo have significantly different climates. In fact, as a football fan, I often hear that southern states suffer against northern states because of the weather. Since I have several historical game scores, point spreads, and weather variables, I thought this would be a great test. Do northern teams benefit from playing in colder states? Is the outcome of a game attributed to the weather? Can we predict if a northern home team will win, simply by looking at weather patterns?

The project contains the R codebook, a word document that details the final analysis, and the datasets used.
